### Powershell Cmdlets
The powershell cmdlets are written to help contributors with collecting the signature data required to populate the whitelist database.

[Get-FileSignatures](/PS1/Get-FileSignatures.ps1) supports data collection

[Get-RepositoryData](/PS1/Get-RepositoryData.ps1) retrieves data from the online repository with known good files and hashes

[Get-RepositoryDataAnalysis](/PS1/Get-RepositoryDataAnalysis.ps1) analyzes the data for matches retrieved by Get-RepositoryData

[Verify-FileHashes](/PS1/Verify-FileHashes.ps1) allows for rapid comparison of file hashes with known reference data
